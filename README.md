# Human Crossing Frontend

This is the front end repository for Human Crossing. You can find the backend repository by searching backend_mod5_project in my (@rrosenb12) GitHub profile. This project is intended for Animal Crossing: New Horizons fanatics (like myself). So far, it's a great way to keep track of your progress in the museum and collect data on fish/bugs/sea creatures. It featuers an extensive search tool, a customizable profile page that updates in real time, and an option to upload images, as well as see other images from other users (which you can filter through in the Gallery by tag).

## To use this project, you'll need to run the backend at the same time.

Head on over there to get it set up and then come back here :)

...

Did you do it? Cool! Now, clone this repository and run the following commands in your terminal:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. `Y`

*** You will want to make sure that the backend is running on localhost:3000 and the frontend is working on whatever other port you want. ***
### To Repeat: Please Have the Backend Running on localhost:3000. ###

You are now ready to use the app!
